When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you work from more than one computer, e.g. home and office or laptop.
If more than one person is working on the project, you need a central place to collect updates.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you don't know who else has changed the repository or what was changed, automatic updates could introduce code that's incompatible with what you have or break things you've already fixed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are copies of someone else's repository that you can't change, while clones are copies of a repository you are allowed to edit. Branches are different versions of the same codebase in a repository.
You use clones and branches when working on your own code, especially with multiple people. You use a fork when you want to look at and possibly change someone else's project and possibly later request your changes be added back to the original project.

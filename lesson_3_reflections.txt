When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you work from more than one computer, e.g. home and office or laptop.
If more than one person is working on the project, you need a central place to collect updates.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you don't know who else has changed the repository or what was changed, automatic updates could introduce code that's incompatible with what you have or break things you've already fixed.
